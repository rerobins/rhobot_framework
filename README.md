# Rho Core Library

Rho Core Library is a python library that provides common functionality for discovery and interaction between 'bots'
that are responsible for providing unique units of functionality.
  
The framework is developed on top of XMPP in order to handle discovery and data passing.  This implementation of the 
Rho Core library relies heavily on a slightly modified version of SleekXMPP.
